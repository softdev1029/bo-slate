# Overview

## Messaging Overview

Each message in the API is preceded by a 4 byte header. This header conveys the following information:

* Message type. The ﬁrst byte of the header is always a character indicating the type of message to follow. Example: data\[0\] = ‘T’. The second byte is reserved to accommodate double character message types.
* Immediately following the 2 byte message type is a 2 byte short integer containing the total length of the message including the 4 byte message header. The length is a short integer \(2 bytes\) and is found in the 3rd and 4th bytes of the header.

| Field Name | Data type | Data Length | Buffer Offset | Example Value |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Data1 | char | 1 | 0 | 'H' |
| Data2 | char | 1 | 1 |  |
| Data3 | short | 2 | 2 | 161 |

### Application Messages

Application messages contain the data necessary to perform the operations indicated by the message type. Application messages always contain the 4 byte header followed by the actual data message. The type of message which follows the header is always found in the 1st byte of the header as described above. The length of the message including the header is always found in the 3rd and 4th bytes of the header as described above.

1. **Excel spreadsheets for each message in the API are included with the documentation. All spreadsheets include:**
   1. Message Name
   2. Field Names
   3. Data type of each ﬁeld
   4. Buﬀer oﬀset of each ﬁeld in the message buﬀer for sending/receiving.
   5. Total length of the message
   6. Required ﬁelds for client and server

## Symbol Enums

Symbol Enums are replacements for the character based instrument name to a short integer. Symbols Enums are included in almost all Black Ocean messages pertaining to orders, risk management and reporting. Symbol Enums are used to replace hashing functions necessary to ﬁnd either orders, instrument data or risk information normally associated with instruments in most other trading systems. It is essential they be included in the messages which require them. Failure to include them will result in a reject of the message and wrong symbol Enums will result in undeﬁned behavior. Amer the login is complete, the user can send a BOInstrumentRequest message to the OES \(Order Entry Server\) and will receive back a BOInstrument message which contains all information for each instrument including the symbol name and the symbol Enum for that symbol name. The BOInstrumentRequest and BOInstrument messages will be covered in detail in a subsequent section.
